<h3>Policy on Academic Honesty:</h3> 
The academic honesty policy as described 
in the University Faculty Handbook as well as the Student Handbook will be
strictly enforced. Please review the document 
<a href="https://codeofconduct.gsu.edu/files/2019/07/2019_7_3_Academic_Honesty.pdf">
Academic Honesty Policy</a>. Other topics related to student conduct are available at
<a href="https://codeofconduct.gsu.edu/">https://codeofconduct.gsu.edu/</a>.
<ol>
<li> All assignments are supposed to be individual work and
any collaboration or cheating would result in a zero score for the assignment.
</li>
<li> A second incident of dishonest work will result in an automatic F grade
for the class. 
</li>
<li> It is also the repsonsibility of each student to protect his or her work
including computer files etc from being extracted by others. Computer accounts
will be de-activated immediately if the student is found to have been
careless in maintaining his or her files (i.e. has kept them open for
others to read!). If such carelessness results in another student
copying the computer files and submitting them for the assignments all students
involved will automatically get a zero for the assignment.
</li>
</ol>

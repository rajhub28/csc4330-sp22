<h3>Csc 4330/6330, Handin Instructions</h3>

<P> You will need to transfer your files to the tinman.cs.gsu.edu server
and then submit all files using the following command on tinman.cs.gsu.edu:
<pre>
  $ sudo handin4330 1 file1.py file2.py file3.pdf file4.txt
</pre>
<P>
This will prompt you for your unix password. You should see one SUCCESS message 
for each file you submit.
Resubmissions are allowed under the same file name and the handin script will ask 
you whether you want to overwrite the old submission file.
<P>
NOTE: The 1 in the command refers to the assignment number. For assignment 2, this 
should be 2, and so on.
<P> You may use the following command to "view" all your submissions for a 
particular assignment:
<pre>
$ sudo handin4330 -list 1
</pre>
where the 1 in the command is the assignment number. This can be replaced by other
assignment numbers.
<P> <b>NOTE: CSc 6330 students will also use the same command</a>
